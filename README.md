# Operations Research Examples

These exercises were completed as part of an Operations Research class at Drexel University with Dr. Hande Benson.  My first exposure to AMPL was Fall 2015 and since I have grown to appreciate the intricacy of linear and non-linear optimization.  I find these types of problems extremely fun since each scenario poses its own unique challenges that do not have a “cookie-cutter” solution.  Although I rate my AMPL skill as rudimentary, over the course of my studies I have been exposed to varying problems and have been able to tackle them with decreasing rates of Googling.
