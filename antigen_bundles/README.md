Combinational vaccines, or Antigen Bundles, combine two or more vaccines in one shot.  These vaccines are preferred in high-income countries but are prohibitively expensive for middle and low-income countries.  Manufacturers often prefer or are pressured to produce bundle vaccines for developed countries years before producing for low-income countries.  The optimization problem tries to create a model for a segmented pricing strategy that maximizes social utility, which the study calls social welfare.

This paper strives to partially replicate the work done in “Making combination vaccines more accessible to low-income countries: The antigen bundle pricing problem.”
